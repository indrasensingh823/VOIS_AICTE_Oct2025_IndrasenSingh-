# 🏨 Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Airbnb Hotel Booking Data** to understand customer booking behavior, pricing strategies, and location preferences.  
Using **Python and Data Visualization tools**, the project provides insights that can help both **hosts** and **travelers** make better decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze Airbnb bookings across different neighborhoods.  
- Understand price variations by location and room type.  
- Identify the most popular room types and listings.  
- Study seasonal booking trends and availability.  
- Provide insights for hosts and business researchers.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps  
- Removed duplicate and missing records.  
- Fixed spelling errors (e.g., “brookln” → “Brooklyn”).  
- Converted **price** and **date** columns into correct data types.  
- Dropped irrelevant columns such as `license` and `house_rules`.  
- Removed outliers (like unrealistic availability > 500 days).  
- Ensured consistent numeric formatting for price and service fees.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
### Key Findings  
- 🏙️ **Manhattan** and **Brooklyn** have the highest number of listings.  
- 💰 **Manhattan** properties are most expensive, **Bronx** the least.  
- 🏠 **Entire home/apartment** is the most booked room type.  
- 📅 **Summer and holidays** see the highest booking activity.  
- 🌟 **Customer reviews** directly impact booking frequency.

## 📊 Visualizations  
The project includes:  
- Neighborhood-wise booking distribution.  
- Room type and price comparison.  
- Seasonal availability charts.  
- Price density plots and correlation heatmaps.
